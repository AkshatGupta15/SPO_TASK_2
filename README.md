# Planet Api Data Fetch and Caching

implemented using local storage and saving data with expiry time so that it wont fetch again the data but after expriry time if releoded data is fetched again from api rather than from local storage thus reducing loading time and instantlly showing data

for caching data used localstorage with custom attributes for expiry time by making a custom function

### BROWNIE POINTS 

try to implement worker service for the first time and make site available even in offline by caching the site with a custom offline.html page
